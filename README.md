## Standalone Desktop App (Free, Build It Yourself)

You can build Deep-Live-Cam as a self-contained desktop application — no Python, pip, or ffmpeg installation needed by the end user. The result is a double-clickable app for Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Linux.

<details>
<summary>Click to see how</summary>

### Step 1 — Get the app

Download a pre-built bundle from the repository's **Releases** page (every tagged release, and any manual run of the **Desktop App Build** workflow under *Actions*, produces them):

| Platform | File | Run |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 (x64) | `Deep-Live-Cam-windows-x64.zip` | unzip → `Deep-Live-Cam.exe` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Deep-Live-Cam-macos-arm64.zip` | unzip → `Deep-Live-Cam.app` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `Deep-Live-Cam-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | extract → `Deep-Live-Cam/Deep-Live-Cam` |

### Step 2 — First launch

The bundles are unsigned, so the OS will warn you once:

- **Windows**: SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC" → click **More info** → **Run anyway**.
- **macOS**: right-click the app → **Open** → **Open** (instead of double-clicking, the first time only).
- **Linux**: no warning; if it doesn't start, make sure the binary is executable (`chmod +x Deep-Live-Cam/Deep-Live-Cam`).

On first launch the app downloads the AI models (~600 MB). **There is no progress window** — the main window appears after the download completes, so give it a few minutes on the first run. Download progress is written to `app.log` (locations below).

### Step 3 — Use it

**Live webcam mode:**

1. Click **Select a face** and pick a clear, front-facing photo of the face you want to wear.
2. In the **Camera** section, choose your webcam from the dropdown.
3. Click **Live** and wait 10–30 seconds for the preview window (models load into memory on first use).
4. To stream the result into Zoom/Discord/OBS, capture the preview window with OBS and use its Virtual Camera.

**Image or video file mode:**

1. Click **Select a face** (the source face).
2. Click **Select a target** and pick the image or video to swap onto.
3. Click **Start**. The output is written next to the target file; progress is shown in the status bar.

Useful options: **Many faces** swaps every detected face; **Mouth Mask** keeps your original mouth movement (more natural speech); **Face Enhancer** improves quality at the cost of speed.

### Performance expectations

- The face swap runs on your GPU when possible: **DirectML** on Windows (any DirectX 12 GPU — NVIDIA, AMD, Intel iGPU), **CoreML** on Apple Silicon, **CPU** on Linux bundles.
- A dedicated GPU and 16 GB+ RAM give a smooth live experience. On integrated GPUs (e.g. Intel Iris Xe) expect modest frame rates, and on 8 GB RAM close other apps first.
- No usable GPU? See "Processing on a cloud GPU server" below.

### Troubleshooting

- **App seems frozen on first launch** → it's downloading models; check progress in `app.log` (locations below).
- **Something crashed / weird behavior** → read `app.log` and open an issue with its contents.
- **Model download keeps failing** (offline machine, proxy) → download [inswapper_128.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128.onnx) manually and place it in the models folder listed below, then restart the app.
- **Live preview is black** → check the OS camera permission (Windows: Settings → Privacy → Camera → allow desktop apps; macOS: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera).

### Processing on a cloud GPU server (no local GPU)

For fast video-file processing without local GPU hardware, rent an NVIDIA VM (AWS g4dn/g5, GCP T4/L4, Paperspace, Lambda — roughly $0.30–1.00/hour) and run:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> deep-live-cam && cd deep-live-cam
bash packaging/cloud-gpu-setup.sh

source venv/bin/activate
python run.py -s face.jpg -t input.mp4 -o output.mp4 \
    --execution-provider cuda --keep-fps
```

The script installs all system and Python dependencies and verifies CUDA before you spend GPU time. Remember to stop the instance when done — billing is hourly. (Live webcam over a remote VM is not recommended; camera forwarding latency makes it impractical.)

### Build locally

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File packaging\build.ps1

# macOS / Linux
packaging/build.sh
```

The script creates a build virtualenv, installs dependencies plus PyInstaller, generates the app icon, downloads a static ffmpeg/ffprobe to bundle, and produces the archive in `dist/`.

### Where the app keeps its files

Models (~600 MB, downloaded on first launch), settings (`switch_states.json`), and the log (`app.log`) live in a per-user data folder — the install folder itself is never written to:

| Platform | Data folder |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Deep-Live-Cam` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Deep-Live-Cam` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/deep-live-cam` |

ffmpeg/ffprobe are bundled inside the app; if missing, the app falls back to the system `PATH`. For NVIDIA CUDA acceleration, run from source as described below. Full status, performance notes, and upgrade paths are logged in [docs/desktop-app-notes.md](docs/desktop-app-notes.md).

## Installation (Manual)

**Please be aware that the installation requires technical skills and is not for beginners. Consider downloading the quickstart version.**

<details>
<summary>Click to see the process</summary>

### Installation

This is more likely to work on your computer but will be slower as it utilizes the CPU.

**1. Set up Your Platform**

-   Python (3.11 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) - ```iex (irm ffmpeg.tc.ht)```
-   [Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

**2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git
cd Deep-Live-Cam
```

**3. Download the Models**

1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.onnx)
2. [inswapper\_128\_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)

Place these files in the "**models**" folder.

**4. Install Dependencies**

We highly recommend using a `venv` to avoid issues.


For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For Linux:
```bash
# Ensure you use the installed Python 3.11
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For macOS:**

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) requires specific setup:

```bash
# Install Python 3.11 (specific version is important)
brew install python@3.11

# Install tkinter package (required for the GUI)
brew install python-tk@3.11

# Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

** In case something goes wrong and you need to reinstall the virtual environment **

```bash
# Deactivate the virtual environment
rm -rf venv

# Reinstall the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install the dependencies again
pip install -r requirements.txt

# gfpgan and basicsrs issue fix
pip install git+https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR.git@master
pip uninstall gfpgan -y
pip install git+https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git@master
```

**Run:** If you don't have a GPU, you can run Deep-Live-Cam using `python run.py`. Note that initial execution will download models (~300MB).

### GPU Acceleration

**CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)**

1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 12.8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-8-0-download-archive)
